Struggles:
I struggled with passing pointers throughout this project. Originally I planned on keeping my logic for commands in a seperate c file and use a header file, but ran into an issue with the compiler creating new memory addresses no matter how I passed the pointer. After using the CS Lab tutoring, showing it to the professor and attempting to debug on the fox machines for about 6 hours I decided to go with the current setup.
Research sources:
I did research on the getpid, fork, chdir, and cwd from geeksforgeeks and tutorialspoints.
